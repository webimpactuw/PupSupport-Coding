# PupSupport

This is the repo for the new PupSupport webpage by Web Impact UW!

Later this README will contain details for how to navigate the repo,
any configuration information, sources/resources, etc.

Note that within /src there are subdirectories: assets, components, css, and pages. These have READMEs that detail what each subdirectory is for. As we add to the repo, these will likely be unnecessary, but for now they're there to label our structure.
