# PupSupport-Coding

This is the repo for the new PupSupport webpage by DUBvelopers!

Later this README will contain details for how to navigate the repo, 
any configuration information, sources/resources, etc.

If you have any questions ask Jaela!

Note that within /src there are subdirectories: assets, components, css, and pages. These have READMEs that detail what each subdirectory is for. As we add to the repo, these will likley be unnecessary, but for now they're there to label our structure.
